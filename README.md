### 📊 Purchasing Trend Analysis
- Stable quantity & price trends except for outliers caused by bulk purchases & refunds (members) and high-value purchases/refunds (non-members).
- Transaction volume shows a 7-day seasonality with spikes on Mondays (likely B2B restocking) and an overall growth trend.
### 🌍 Market Identification
- United Kingdom is the dominant market.
- Different countries have distinct product preferences, requiring tailored inventory strategies.
### 🛍 Customer Segmentation (UK Market)
- Members buy 8x more per transaction (B2B customers).
- Non-members spend 2x more per item → Opportunity for premium product recommendations.
- RFM-based Clustering (4 groups) → Targeted strategies for key customers, at-risk customers, and high-refund customers.
